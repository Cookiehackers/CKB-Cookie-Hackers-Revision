# Cookie-Clicker-Buffs
Small, non-coding based Repository for all your cookie clicker needs. 
The initial idea of this Repository is for bored Cookie Clicker players looking for hacks and such.
We **are not** responsible for anything that happens to your save, or your computer.
It will be your responsibility to back up your save in any way.
If your file gets corrupted, or anything else, **We are NOT liable.**
Every save is **hacked**, and not authentic. So we aren't enslaving people to get these saves this far in under 24 hours.
Or are we...

Reminder, we **ARE** trying to ruin the game. And we **DO NOT** have some useless excuse for hacking it.
Of course, Orneil fully condones hacking, and has added two **shadow achievements** for hackers exclusively. 

**Dungeon Achievements** are unavailable, so if a save has them, **it is hacked**
